# Fake Store App &#128717;

Simple as it can be. An e-commerce app with a couple pages to browse and show products based on categories.

This a project that I wanted to do since when I started learning the basics of frontend development. 
It uses a free online REST API, [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/), with pseudo-real data for an e-commerce or shopping website.
